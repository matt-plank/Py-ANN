# Contributing

When contributing to this project please keep a couple of things in mind:
- We have a [Code of Coduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT) that we expect all contributors to follow
- All changes should be made through the process below

## Contributing Process

1. Open an issue for any changes that you're planning on making and assign yourself to it.
2. Fork the repository
3. Create a branch with the naming scheme:
    - feature/\<issue number\> for new features
    - bugfix/\<issue number\> for bug fixes and tech debt
4. Make all of your code changes, but stick to our [code standards](CODE_STANDARDS)
5. Ensure all tests pass before you commit anything - if tests are breaking that you have nothing to do with, check you've installed everything correctly and then open a bug issue.
6. Commit your changes with reference to the issue number, e.g. "Closes #13. Did some things" or "Related to #13. Did some things"
7. Rebase your branch onto develop
8. Open a Pull Request into develop of the main project
9. A member of the project will review your changes and give you the go ahead to merge in or suggest changes
