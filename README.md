# Py-ANN

A light-weight, fast Artificial Neural Network (ANN) implementation in Python.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To use this project you'll need to have installed:

* Python 3

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get this project running.

#### On Ubuntu

1. Clone the repository
    ```shell
    git clone http://www.github.com/matt-plank/Py-ANN
    ```
2. Run the install script
    ```shell script
    cd ./Py-ANN/src
    ./install.sh
    ```

#### On Windows

1. Clone the repository
2. Move Py-ANN/src/PyANN to your python modules folder or to the directory you want to use it in

## Examples

Try some examples!

```shell script
cd ./Py-ANN/src
python3 examples/<exmaple name>.py
```

### Xor

The simplest application of deep learning, training a deep neural network to act as a logical XOR gate.

```shell script
cd ./Py-ANN/src
python3 examples/xor.py
```

## Running the tests

The automated unit tests can be run with the test script `tests.sh`.

```shell script
cd ./Py-ANN/src
./tests.sh
```

You must have installed the dependencies (using `install.sh`) to run the tests.

## Deployment

Installing this and using it on a live system is identical to installing on your home system! Just run the install script.
