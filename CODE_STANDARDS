# Code Standards

- Avoid duplicate code
- Exceptions
    - Only capture exceptions you can deal with at the point of capture
    - Avoid bare exceptions
- Imports
    - Imports must be side effect free
    - Imports must be ordered
    - Requirements must be ordered
- Strings favour `f""` or `.format` over `%s` or string concatenation syntax 
- "Magic Numbers" should have their own variables - numbers that appear in equations or statements should always have their own variables
- Readline at the end of a file
- Comments
    - Code should be self explanatory - but comments should be used where possible to save time for others trying to skim read your code
    - Google style docstrings must be used throughout the code base to describe functions and classes
